Paste the header you copied into the form and click **Submit**.

### 7. Copy the Coordinates

Once it analyzes the email, it may show **IP address details** with **coordinates** (latitude and longitude).

### 8. Paste on Google Maps

Copy those coordinates and search them on [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com) to view the approximate sender location.

## 🛑 Note:

- This method works only if the sender’s IP is visible in the header.  
- Most modern email services (like Gmail, Outlook) hide IPs for privacy reasons.  
- Still, it’s a useful method for OSINT, cybersecurity investigation, or education.
