Greetings everyone. Today, I want to tell you how I found **CVE-2021-29115**, which is an Information Disclosure vulnerability, in a bug bounty program in just a few minutes. To keep things anonymous, let's call the target website "redacted.com."

To begin my exploration, I used a subdomain enumeration tool named Subfinder. This tool helped me find any subdomains linked to redacted.com.

```
$ subfinder -d redacted.com
```
Once I had put together a list of subdomains, I picked one and started exploring content using the ffuf tool. I ran this command:

```
$ ffuf -u https://subdomain.redacted.com/FUZZ -w dicc.txt
```
As I ran the scan, I discovered something interesting: the endpoint /server returned a 301 redirect status. Intrigued by this redirect, I tried to access the endpoint in my browser. It quickly redirected me to the following endpoint: /server/rest/services.

This caught my interest, so I began to look into the /server/rest/services endpoint more closely. Through some testing, I found that the endpoint had an Information Disclosure vulnerability (CVE-2021-29115). This flaw allowed me to access sensitive information about the application and its environment.

I reported this vulnerability to the bug bounty program and earned a Hall of Fame recognition for my findings. This shows how a few simple tools and some persistence can lead to a successful bug bounty hunt!
